# progress-tree

It is a join project by me and [**Mahesh Nayak**](https://github.com/hmaheshnayak). We make an alternative to progress bar where progress is visualized by growing leaf on a leafless tree. Every part of the tree (branches and leaves) are a separate SVG element so it can be attached with data and manipulate accordingly.

It is a binary tree modeled using [L-system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system) and the code is inspired by Peter Cook's [d3-tree](http://prcweb.co.uk/lab/d3-tree/). Since this is a binary tree, the number of branches and trees are multiples of 2.
